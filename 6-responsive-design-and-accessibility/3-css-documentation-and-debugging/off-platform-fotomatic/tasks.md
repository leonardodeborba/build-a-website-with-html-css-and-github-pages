# Off-Platform Project: Fotomatic

## Fix a broken version of a responsive website in this project!

In this project, you will fix a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic. You will be provided with specs to help guide you in making adjustments to the broken code. To get started, download the broken code and the design specs! You can also see a working version of the [final product](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/full-stack-career-journey/Fotomatic/final/index.html).

As you fix Fotomatic’s bugs, remember to use the skills you acquired in the Chrome DevTools article to help you decipher and update the site’s CSS. Chrome DevTools are essential for debugging – they allow you to view current style values, toggle rules, and test different rule values.

# Fotomatic Project Solution

## Compare your work to the solution code!

You can download the solution code to the Fotomatic project here.

Try not to peek at the solution code until you’ve completed this part of the project, or unless you’re really stuck and your struggle has become totally unproductive. Looking at the code before that moment will deprive you of an important learning opportunity and will make it harder for you to achieve your ultimate outcome.
